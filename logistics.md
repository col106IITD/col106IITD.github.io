**Evaluation:** The tentative course evaluation policy is:

Lab Quizzes (best X out of Y):  %
Minor:  %
Major:  %
Quizzes :  %
Passing criteria: % in course total

Audit-pass criteria: % in course total

Acadmic Honesty: Cheating or allowing anyone to copy in exams/lab-assignments would lead to strict disciplinary action. Typical penalty would include Fail grade in the course.
